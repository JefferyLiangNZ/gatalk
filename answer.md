AWS Lambda will dynamically scale capacity in response to increased traffic, subject to the concurrent executions limit. To handle any burst in traffic, AWS Lambda will immediately increase your concurrently executing functions by a predetermined amount, dependent on which region it's executed. I've noticed that 42 of the lambda function is in ap-southeast-2, so the immediate function executions concurrency increase is 500[3]. If the default Immediate Concurrency Increase value is not sufficient to accommodate the traffic surge, AWS Lambda will continue to increase the number of concurrent function executions by 500 per minute until your account safety limit has been reached or the number of concurrently executing functions is sufficient to successfully process the increased load. 

So the graph you've attached, the concurrency is around 200 concurrent execution is normal. Concurrent executions refers to the number of executions of your function code that are happening at any given time. You can estimate the concurrent execution count, but the concurrent execution count will differ depending on whether or not your Lambda function is processing events from a poll-based event source. Reference[3] have provided several examples about how to estimate your concurrent execution based on different behaviors. You could set you concurrent execution values based on your needs. Reference[5] would help you have a better understanding of lambda function concurrency.
